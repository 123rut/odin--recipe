    <p>Kaju katli (lit. 'Cashew slice') is an Indian dessert. 
        Kaju means cashew; barfi is often made by thickening milk with sugar and other ingredients 
        (such as dry fruits and mild spices). Kesar kaju katli includes saffron. 
        It is similar to barfi, but unlike barfi, it typically contains no milk.
        

        The dish is prepared with cashew nuts soaked in water for a considerable period of time
         (usually overnight), which are then ground to a paste. 
         Sugar solution is boiled down until a single thread forms when two fingers are dipped into it a
         nd pulled apart, after which it is added to the ground cashews. Ghee, saffron (kesar), 
         and dried fruits may also be added.[1] The paste is then spread and flattened in a shallow, 
         flat-bottomed dish and cut into bite-sized rhombus-shaped pieces. 
         The pieces are usually decorated with edible silver foil. 
         The finished sweet is usually white or yellow in color depending on the ingredients used for the paste 
         and the proportions of each used. Kaju Katli is traditionally eaten during the Hindu festival of Diwali.

                1. Place 1 cup cashews (kaju) in a dry grinder or coffee grinder or blender. I usually keep cashews at room temperature. Hence the cashews are dry.
                Avoid using refrigerated or f
                rozen cashews as they will release moisture once ground and turn more into a cashew paste.</li>

  <li>2. Grind the kaju to a smooth powder, making sure you don’t over do the grinding process as fat should not release from the cashews.

    I ran the mixer at a stretch first and then scraped the sides and ran again at intervals for a couple of times.
    
    The cashews should be in powder form and not become pasty or buttery like cashew butter.
    
    If there are tiny pieces in the cashew powder, t
    hen just let it be – or you can also sieve the cashew powder and set aside. Use a medium fine sieve and not 
    a fine one to sift the powdered cashews.</li>

<li>3. Combine ½ cup sugar and 5 tablespoons water in a thick bottomed pan (or kadai or a non-stick pan).</li>
